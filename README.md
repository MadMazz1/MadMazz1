- 👋 Hi, I’m @MadMazz1
- 👀 Cyber Security is my thang, Fluent in Python, C#(Limited), HTML5(Fair), JS(Limited), CISCO Networking CCENT/A+ Ready, Congressional Award in CyberSecurity(2011)
- 🌱 Getting heavier into front-end/backend development as of late. This Git will store my current projects. This is a mostly private Git.
<br /><br />-Anything made public will be for the purposes of learning/discussion. It is <b>illegal*</b> to use/deploy/inject software/scripts without the consent of the person you intend to use them on. Be ETHICAL. I suggest using a controlled virtual env to test them on yourself, so that you may learn. Don't be an idiot... You will be held responsible for any resulting damage.
- 💞️ Not exactly looking to 'Collab' - Just building a portfolio.
